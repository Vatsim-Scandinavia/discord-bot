I believe you're asking about the waiting time for training in VATSIM Scandinavia. The waiting time varies between countries, but generally it can be up to 12 months.

It's impossible to give you a queue number or exact estimate, because the training queue is dynamic and varies with a couple of factors such as:

- Mentor availability,
- Which rating a mentor can train,
- How long existing students use on their training,
- Other training types that have higher priority

We recommend you to use the time while waiting to familiarize yourself with the VATSIM network, read through the training documents, and piloting skills are also very useful in your future training and understanding.
